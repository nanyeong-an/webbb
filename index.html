Everything would be Samsung or LG goodness: TVs everywhere, robot vaccuums, robot fridges, robot toilets. IT WOULD BE GLORIOUS! It’s not glorious. It turns out, supposedly, that the cheapest electronics you can get are from North America, even with products that are originally from Japan and Korea. Don’t freaking ask me why. All I know is that I’ve seen similar products in from Japan and Korea much cheaper in Canada. Why is that? I’d think that, without having to ship the product halfway around the world, that you’d save a buck or two. Nope. More expensive here. That sucks

    ">Coffee </a>: OHMAIGAT! It’s not cheap here at all. Ever. You’ll find Americanos starting at roughly 4,000 won. You won’t find drip coffees. A Tim Horton’s double double for under a couple of bucks…GLORIOUS! Here, not glorious. Espresso based drinks are all the rage here. If you want a coffee that just got pushed through a drip machine: good luck with that. They’ve got “hand-drip” coffee, in which they make it for you by hand, and it’s delicious, but it’s, like, 5,000-6,000 won. AYYYYYYYY!!! So, yeah. We spend a lot of money every month on coffee. It’s so expensive here!</p>
